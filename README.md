# React Quizz

A personal project to learn React aside from my OpenClassroom courses.

## I made 3 types of questions

- True or False
- Blind test (music)
- Type the answer

## In this project I learned

- How to dynamically create *n* pages based on an array of questions
- How to use React Howler to play sounds (didn't dig further than play/pause yet)
- A bit more about React Virtual DOM
- How to build a prize wheel
- How to manage states and pass them as props from higher level components
- How to handle game progress and navigation
- How to rig a prize wheel :sweat_smile:
- React PropTypes

## What I would like to do next

- Improve CSS layout
- Make it responsive
- Replace questions by good ones and not placeholders
- Add more music/text questions
- Learn drag and drop to pull the prize wheel lever and insert coin (for desktop and/or touch)
- Create new types of questions : mini games (with drag and drop too), or picture/video questions
- Learn useContext() hook
- Add sounds
- Add CSS animations on buttons from event types I'm not familiar with (onMouseDown / onMouseUp)
- Rebuild it in TypeScript when JS version will be good enough
- Add a basic Node backend
- Add a feature to export the prizes won ia txt file

## What I won't do

- Send you Deep Purple tickets (only for my GF). :stuck_out_tongue:
